## Testing Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Component Testing Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('Basic Rendering', () => {
    // Basic rendering tests
  });
  
  describe('User Interactions', () => {
    // Click, keyboard, form interactions
  });
  
  describe('Accessibility', () => {
    // WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation
  });
  
  describe('Responsive Design', () => {
    // Mobile, tablet, desktop testing
  });
  
  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    // Error states, empty data, invalid inputs
  });
});
```

### 2. Mock Strategies
- **Component Mocking**: Mock child components to isolate testing
- **Hook Mocking**: Mock custom hooks with controlled return values
- **API Mocking**: Mock API calls with MSW or vi.mock
- **Browser API Mocking**: Mock window, localStorage, etc.

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- Automated axe-core testing for WCAG compliance
- Keyboard navigation verification
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management testing

### 4. Responsive Design Testing
- Multiple viewport size testing
- Touch interaction testing
- Mobile-specific behavior verification
- Responsive layout validation

### 5. Performance Testing
- Render time measurement
- Memory usage monitoring
- Large dataset handling
- Component optimization verification
