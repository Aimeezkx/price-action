- **Difficulty Range**: Min/max difficulty selection

### Search Management
- **Search History**: Automatic tracking of recent searches with timestamps
- **Saved Searches**: User-named saved searches with full filter state
- **Local Persistence**: Browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Quick Actions**: One-click reload of previous searches
- **Management Tools**: Clear history, delete saved searches

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with collapsible sidebar
- **Loading States**: Skeleton animations and loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user feedback
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Visual Feedback**: Active filter indicators, result counts, search scores

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- TanStack Query for server state and caching
- localStorage for persistence
- Proper state synchronization between components

### API Integration
- GET `/api/search` for search results
- GET `/api/search/suggestions` for real-time suggestions
- Support for all backend search parameters and filters
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced suggestion requests
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient state updates with proper dependency arrays
- Lazy loading of filter options

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast compliance
