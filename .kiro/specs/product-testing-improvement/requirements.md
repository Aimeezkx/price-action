# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive testing and improvement of the document learning application. The system needs thorough validation of all features, performance optimization, bug fixes, and user experience enhancements to ensure production readiness. This includes automated testing, manual testing scenarios, performance benchmarking, and iterative improvements based on test results.

3. WHEN running API tests THEN the system SHALL validate all endpoints with proper error handling
4. WHEN running frontend tests THEN the system SHALL validate all UI components and user interactions
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2: Performance Testing and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform efficiently so that I can use it without delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL complete processing within acceptable time limits (30s for 10-page PDF)
2. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms
3. WHEN loading the frontend THEN the system SHALL load within 2 seconds
4. WHEN reviewing cards THEN the system SHALL respond to interactions within 200ms
5. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL identify and report bottlenecks

### Requirement 3: End-to-End User Workflow Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want all features to work together seamlessly so that I can complete my learning workflows without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a document THEN the system SHALL process it completely and generate reviewable cards
2. WHEN browsing chapters THEN the system SHALL display all content correctly with proper navigation
3. WHEN studying cards THEN the system SHALL track progress and schedule reviews correctly
4. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL find relevant results and allow filtering
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL generate correct files that can be imported elsewhere

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work consistently across different platforms so that I can use it on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the web application THEN it SHALL work correctly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. WHEN using the iOS application THEN it SHALL work correctly on iPhone and iPad devices
3. WHEN syncing data between platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency
4. WHEN switching between platforms THEN the user experience SHALL be seamless
5. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the interface SHALL adapt properly to different screen sizes

### Requirement 5: Data Integrity and Security Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and accurate so that I can trust the system with my learning materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL validate file types and reject malicious files
2. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity throughout the pipeline
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls
4. WHEN enabling privacy mode THEN the system SHALL not transmit data to external services
5. WHEN testing security THEN the system SHALL resist common attack vectors

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully so that I can continue using it even when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
2. WHEN network connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
3. WHEN invalid data is encountered THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and provide helpful feedback
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately for debugging

### Requirement 7: Usability and Accessibility Testing

**User Story:** As a user with diverse needs, I want the application to be accessible and easy to use so that everyone can benefit from it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper accessibility labels and navigation
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all features SHALL be accessible without a mouse
3. WHEN testing with users THEN the interface SHALL be intuitive and easy to learn
4. WHEN using on mobile devices THEN touch interactions SHALL be responsive and accurate
5. WHEN testing color contrast THEN the interface SHALL meet WCAG accessibility guidelines

### Requirement 8: Load and Stress Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand system limits so that I can plan for scaling and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple documents simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
2. WHEN many users access the system THEN it SHALL maintain performance under load
3. WHEN storage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL handle resource constraints gracefully
4. WHEN testing with large documents THEN the system SHALL process them without memory issues
5. WHEN stress testing THEN the system SHALL identify breaking points and recovery behavior

### Requirement 9: Bug Identification and Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix bugs systematically so that the product quality improves continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing reveals bugs THEN they SHALL be documented with reproduction steps
2. WHEN bugs are fixed THEN regression tests SHALL be added to prevent recurrence
3. WHEN critical bugs are found THEN they SHALL be prioritized and fixed immediately
4. WHEN edge cases are discovered THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
5. WHEN bug fixes are deployed THEN they SHALL be verified through testing

### Requirement 10: Feature Enhancement and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continuously improve so that it becomes more useful and efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
