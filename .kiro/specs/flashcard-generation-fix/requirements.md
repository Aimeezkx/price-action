# Flashcard Generation Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The current document learning application has a sophisticated flashcard generation system implemented, but it's not properly connected to the file upload process. Users can upload files, but no flashcards are generated from the uploaded content. This spec addresses fixing the complete pipeline from file upload to flashcard generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Upload and Processing Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a document and have it automatically processed to extract knowledge points for flashcard generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a supported file (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) THEN the system SHALL save the file securely
2. WHEN a file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically queue it for background processing
3. WHEN document processing begins THEN the system SHALL update the document status to "PROCESSING"
4. WHEN document processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the status to "COMPLETED"
5. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL update the status to "FAILED" with error details

### Requirement 2: Document Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded documents to be parsed and have their content extracted into structured knowledge points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is processed THEN the system SHALL extract text, images, and document structure
2. WHEN a DOCX file is processed THEN the system SHALL extract formatted text and maintain heading hierarchy
3. WHEN text content is extracted THEN the system SHALL segment it into meaningful chunks
4. WHEN content is segmented THEN the system SHALL identify and extract key entities (names, concepts, terms)
5. WHEN entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL classify knowledge points by type (definition, fact, theorem, process, example, concept)

### Requirement 3: Automatic Flashcard Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want flashcards to be automatically generated from my uploaded documents without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN knowledge points are extracted THEN the system SHALL automatically generate Q&A flashcards
2. WHEN entities are identified THEN the system SHALL create cloze deletion cards with appropriate blanks
3. WHEN images are present THEN the system SHALL generate image hotspot cards where applicable
4. WHEN cards are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate appropriate difficulty levels
5. WHEN card generation completes THEN the system SHALL save all cards to the database with proper relationships

### Requirement 4: User Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the processing status of my uploaded documents and access the generated flashcards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a document THEN I SHALL see a processing status indicator
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN I SHALL be notified that flashcards are ready
3. WHEN I navigate to the study section THEN I SHALL see flashcards generated from my uploaded documents
4. WHEN I view flashcards THEN I SHALL see the source document and chapter information
5. WHEN I filter flashcards THEN I SHALL be able to filter by document, chapter, or card type

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when document processing fails and the ability to retry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing fails THEN I SHALL see a clear error message explaining what went wrong
2. WHEN processing fails due to unsupported content THEN I SHALL receive specific guidance on supported formats
3. WHEN processing fails due to system errors THEN I SHALL have the option to retry processing
4. WHEN a document is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN processing times out THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and cleanup

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want document processing to be efficient and not block other system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a document THEN the upload SHALL complete quickly regardless of processing time
2. WHEN documents are being processed THEN other system functions SHALL remain responsive
3. WHEN multiple documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be processed in a queue without conflicts
4. WHEN large documents are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them without memory issues
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN I SHALL be able to immediately access the generated flashcards
