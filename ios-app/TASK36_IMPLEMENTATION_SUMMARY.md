- Adaptive feedback patterns
- Battery-optimized implementation

**Feedback Types:**
- Card interactions (flip, grade, swipe)
- Navigation and button presses
- Study session events (start, complete, achievements)
- Error and success notifications
- Image hotspot interactions

**Key Methods:**
- `cardFlip()`, `cardGrade()` - Study-specific feedback
- `sessionComplete()`, `streakAchievement()` - Achievement feedback
- `performanceBasedHaptic()` - Adaptive feedback
- `playPattern()` - Complex feedback sequences

## Integration Service
**File:** `src/services/iOSIntegrationService.ts`

**Purpose:** Centralized management of all iOS-specific features

**Features:**
- Unified initialization and configuration
- App state monitoring and handling
- Feature enable/disable management
- Periodic task scheduling
- Achievement system integration
- Data synchronization coordination

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()` - Set up all iOS features
- `handleAppStateChange()` - Respond to app lifecycle
- `updateStudyProgress()` - Sync across all features
- `enableFeature()`, `disableFeature()` - Feature management

## Component Integration

### Updated Components
1. **FlashCard.tsx** - Added haptic feedback for card flips
2. **GradingInterface.tsx** - Haptic feedback for grading actions
3. **StudyScreen.tsx** - Full integration with all services
4. **ProfileScreen.tsx** - iOS feature settings and controls
5. **App.tsx** - Service initialization on app start

### Key Integration Points
- Automatic widget updates after study sessions
- Notification scheduling based on SRS intervals
- Haptic feedback for all user interactions
- Offline data persistence for all study activities
- Voice command handling throughout the app

## Configuration and Settings

### User Controls (ProfileScreen)
- Toggle notifications on/off
- Enable/disable home screen widget
- Control Siri shortcuts availability
- Adjust haptic feedback intensity
- Manage offline mode settings

### Default Configuration
```typescript
{
  notifications: true,
  widgets: true,
  siriShortcuts: true,
  hapticFeedback: true,
  offlineMode: true,
}
```

## Dependencies Added
- `react-native-push-notification` - Push notifications
- `@react-native-community/push-notification-ios` - iOS notifications
- `react-native-permissions` - Permission management
- `react-native-haptic-feedback` - Haptic feedback
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local storage

## Performance Considerations
