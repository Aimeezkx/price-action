# Load and Stress Testing Framework Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 8: "Create load and stress testing framework" from the product testing improvement specification. The framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities for concurrent operations, multi-user scenarios, database performance, memory limits, and system recovery.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Concurrent Document Processing Tests (`test_concurrent_document_processing.py`)

**Purpose**: Test the system's ability to handle multiple document processing requests simultaneously.

**Key Features**:
- Simulates concurrent document uploads with varying load levels
- Measures processing times, success rates, and resource usage
- Tests low (5), medium (15), and high (25) concurrency scenarios
- Monitors memory and CPU usage during processing
- Validates system behavior under resource constraints

**Test Scenarios**:
- Low concurrency: 5 concurrent uploads, 95% success rate expected
- Medium concurrency: 15 concurrent uploads, 90% success rate expected  
- High concurrency: 25 concurrent uploads, 80% success rate expected
- Resource limits: Monitors memory and CPU usage patterns

### 2. Multi-User Simulation (`test_multi_user_simulation.py`)

**Purpose**: Simulate realistic user behavior patterns with multiple concurrent users.

**Key Features**:
- Three user profiles: Casual (60%), Regular (30%), Power users (10%)
- Realistic action patterns: document upload, study sessions, search, browsing
- Configurable session durations and action frequencies
- Measures overall success rates and response times
- Simulates realistic thinking times and user behavior

**User Profiles**:
- **Casual Users**: 5-15 min sessions, 2 cards/min study intensity, 20% upload frequency
- **Regular Users**: 15-45 min sessions, 3 cards/min study intensity, 40% upload frequency
- **Power Users**: 45-120 min sessions, 4 cards/min study intensity, 70% upload frequency

### 3. Database Load Testing (`test_database_load.py`)

**Purpose**: Test database performance under concurrent operations and high data volumes.

**Key Features**:
- Tests various database operations: reads, writes, joins, aggregations
- Configurable read/write ratios for different workload patterns
- Measures query response times, connection times, and throughput
- Tests with realistic data volumes (100 docs, 1000 knowledge points, 2000 cards)
- Connection pool stress testing

**Operation Types**:
- Simple selects, complex joins, aggregations
- Full-text search simulation
- Batch inserts, updates, deletes
- Large result set handling

### 4. Memory and Resource Limit Testing (`test_memory_resource_limits.py`)

**Purpose**: Test system behavior under memory constraints and resource limitations.

**Key Features**:
- Gradual memory growth testing with leak detection
- Memory limit enforcement and graceful degradation
- Concurrent memory allocation by multiple workers
- Document processing memory simulation
- Resource monitoring and cleanup verification

**Test Scenarios**:
- Gradual growth: Incremental memory allocation with cleanup verification
- Memory limits: Behavior testing under enforced memory constraints
- Concurrent allocation: Multiple workers allocating memory simultaneously
- Document processing: Realistic memory usage patterns during processing

### 5. System Recovery Testing (`test_system_recovery.py`)

**Purpose**: Test the system's ability to recover from various failure scenarios.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple failure types: network timeouts, memory exhaustion, CPU overload
- Recovery time measurement and validation
- System stability verification after recovery
- Background load during recovery testing
- Configurable failure scenarios and recovery thresholds

**Failure Scenarios**:
- Network timeout simulation
- Database connection loss
- Memory exhaustion conditions
- High CPU load situations
- Request flooding attacks
- Corrupted data handling

## Configuration and Orchestration

### Load Test Configuration (`load-stress-test-config.json`)

Comprehensive configuration file supporting:
- Multiple test environments (local, staging, production)
- Configurable test scenarios and thresholds
- Performance benchmarks and success criteria
- User profile definitions and behavior patterns
- Resource limits and monitoring settings

### Test Orchestrator (`run_load_tests.py`)

Central orchestration system that:
- Coordinates all test suites execution
- Generates comprehensive reports (JSON + summary)
- Provides command-line interface for test execution
- Handles test failures and error reporting
- Supports selective test execution

## Test Execution

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run concurrent document processing tests
pytest backend/tests/load/test_concurrent_document_processing.py -v

# Run multi-user simulation
pytest backend/tests/load/test_multi_user_simulation.py -v

# Run database load tests
pytest backend/tests/load/test_database_load.py -v

# Run memory resource tests
pytest backend/tests/load/test_memory_resource_limits.py -v

# Run system recovery tests

```

### Running Complete Load Test Suite

```bash
# Run all load tests with default configuration
python backend/tests/load/run_load_tests.py

# Run with custom parameters
python backend/tests/load/run_load_tests.py \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --max-users 50 \
  --duration 30 \
  --output custom_report.json

# Skip recovery tests (for production environments)
python backend/tests/load/run_load_tests.py --skip-recovery
```

### Using pytest with load test markers
