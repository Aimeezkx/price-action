## Usage

### CLI Interface

The system includes a comprehensive CLI tool for all operations:

```bash
# Create a new issue
python bug_tracking_cli.py create \
  --title "PDF processing timeout" \
  --description "Large PDFs fail to process" \
  --test-case "test_large_pdf" \
  --expected-behavior "Should process within 60s" \
  --actual-behavior "Times out after 30s" \
  --environment '{"os": "Ubuntu", "python": "3.9"}'

# List issues with filters
python bug_tracking_cli.py list --status open --severity high

# Show detailed issue information
python bug_tracking_cli.py show <issue-id>

# Update issue
python bug_tracking_cli.py update <issue-id> \
  --status in_progress \
  --assigned-to developer@example.com

# Mark issue as fixed
python bug_tracking_cli.py mark-fixed <issue-id> <commit-hash>

# Detect issues from logs
python bug_tracking_cli.py detect-logs /path/to/app.log

# Create reproduction script
python bug_tracking_cli.py create-repro <issue-id> --script-type pytest

# Run reproduction script
python bug_tracking_cli.py run-repro <script-id> --verbose

# Verify fix comprehensively
python bug_tracking_cli.py verify-fix <issue-id> <commit-hash>

# Show statistics
python bug_tracking_cli.py stats
```

### REST API

The system provides a complete REST API for integration:

```python
# Create issue
POST /api/bug-tracking/issues
{
  "title": "Document upload fails",
  "description": "Large documents fail to upload",
  "test_case": "test_document_upload",
  "expected_behavior": "Should upload successfully",
  "actual_behavior": "Upload fails with timeout",
  "environment": {"browser": "Chrome", "os": "Windows"},
  "reproduction_steps": [...]
}

# List issues
GET /api/bug-tracking/issues?status=open&severity=high

# Update issue
PUT /api/bug-tracking/issues/{issue_id}
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "assigned_to": "developer@example.com"
}

# Verify fix
POST /api/bug-tracking/issues/{issue_id}/verify-fix-comprehensive
{
  "fix_commit": "abc123def456"
}
```

### Python API

Direct service usage in Python:

```python
from app.services.bug_tracking_service import BugTrackingService, ReproductionStep

# Initialize service
bug_service = BugTrackingService()

# Create issue with reproduction steps
reproduction_steps = [
    ReproductionStep(
        step_number=1,
        action="Upload large PDF",
        expected_result="Should process successfully",
        actual_result="Processing fails with timeout"
    )
]

issue = bug_service.create_issue(
    title="PDF processing timeout",
    description="Large PDFs fail to process",
    test_case="test_large_pdf",
    expected_behavior="Should process within 60s",
    actual_behavior="Times out after 30s",
    environment={"os": "Ubuntu", "python": "3.9"},
    reproduction_steps=reproduction_steps
)

# Detect issues from logs
log_entries = ["ERROR: Memory leak detected", "WARNING: Slow response"]
detected_issues = bug_service.detect_issues_from_logs(log_entries)

# Mark as fixed and generate regression test
fixed_issue = bug_service.mark_issue_fixed(issue.id, "commit_hash")
```

## Automated Detection

### Log Analysis
The system automatically detects issues from application logs using pattern matching:

- **Memory Leaks**: Detects memory-related errors and warnings
- **Performance Issues**: Identifies slow response times and timeouts
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Finds unauthorized access attempts and injection attacks
- **Data Corruption**: Detects data integrity issues and validation failures

### Test Failure Analysis
Automatically creates issues from test failures:

- **Unit Test Failures**: Creates issues for failing unit tests
- **Integration Test Failures**: Tracks integration test problems
- **Performance Test Failures**: Identifies performance regressions
- **Security Test Failures**: Flags security test failures

## Fix Verification Workflow

The system provides comprehensive fix verification through multiple validation rules:

### Required Validations (for approval)
1. **Reproduction Test Verification**: Ensure reproduction scripts no longer reproduce the bug
2. **Regression Test Coverage**: Verify regression tests exist and pass
3. **Unit Test Coverage**: Check unit test coverage for fixed code
4. **Integration Test Verification**: Run integration tests to ensure no breakage
5. **Security Vulnerability Scan**: Scan for new security issues

### Optional Validations (for quality)
1. **Performance Impact Assessment**: Measure performance impact of fixes
2. **Code Quality Check**: Verify code quality metrics are maintained

### Verification Results
- **Passed**: All required validations pass, fix approved for deployment
- **Partial**: Some validations pass, conditional approval with recommendations
- **Failed**: Critical validations fail, fix requires additional work

## Storage and Persistence

The system uses JSON-based storage for simplicity and portability:

- **Issues**: Stored in `bug_tracking/issues.json`
- **Reproduction Scripts**: Stored in `bug_reproduction/scripts/`
- **Verification Results**: Stored in `fix_verification/results/`
- **Reports**: Generated in `*/reports/` directories

## Integration with Testing Pipeline

The bug tracking system integrates with the existing testing infrastructure:

### Automated Detection Integration
```python
# In test runners, automatically detect and report issues
from app.services.bug_tracking_service import BugTrackingService

def handle_test_failure(test_result):
    bug_service = BugTrackingService()
    issues = bug_service.detect_issues_from_test_failures(test_result)
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"Created issue: {issue.id} - {issue.title}")
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# In GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD
- name: Run Bug Detection
  run: |
    python bug_tracking_cli.py detect-logs logs/application.log
    python bug_tracking_cli.py stats
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `BUG_TRACKING_STORAGE_PATH`: Storage path for bug tracking data
- `BUG_TRACKING_AUTO_DETECT`: Enable/disable automated detection
- `BUG_TRACKING_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK`: Webhook for issue notifications

### Service Configuration
```python
# Custom storage path
bug_service = BugTrackingService(storage_path="/custom/path")

# Custom validation rules
verification_service = BugFixVerificationService()
verification_service.validation_rules.append(custom_rule)
```

## Best Practices

### Issue Creation
1. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide comprehensive issue descriptions
2. **Reproduction Steps**: Include step-by-step reproduction instructions
3. **Environment Information**: Capture complete environment details
4. **Expected vs Actual**: Clearly define expected and actual behavior

### Fix Verification
1. **Run All Validations**: Ensure all required validations pass
2. **Address Recommendations**: Consider optional validation recommendations
3. **Document Changes**: Update issue with fix details and verification results
4. **Regression Testing**: Always create regression tests for fixed issues

### Maintenance
1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old closed issues periodically
2. **Statistics Review**: Monitor issue trends and patterns
3. **Process Improvement**: Update detection patterns and validation rules
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep reproduction documentation current

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Automated detection not working**
- Check log file permissions and format
- Verify detection patterns in `BugDetector`
- Ensure log entries contain detectable patterns

**Issue: Reproduction scripts failing**
- Verify test environment setup
- Check script dependencies and requirements
- Ensure test data is available and accessible

**Issue: Fix verification failing**
- Check that all required tools are installed (pytest, flake8, etc.)
- Verify test files exist and are executable
- Ensure database and services are running for integration tests

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Run operations with debug logging
bug_service = BugTrackingService()
```
